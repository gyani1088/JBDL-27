Command to run spring boot application from terminal -

Sample object present in IOC container
demoConfig is com.example.jbdl.demobeans.DemoConfig$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$8e3cbb44@5a580161


IOC 
1. Instead of you creating an object yourself, spring will be creating one for you
2. but you need to notify spring for that by writing annotations or xml files
3. After the object is created by spring, it will be stored in IOC container / Application context

Bean Scopes
/**
 * For prototype beans, the object is initialized when it is required / autowired by some other beans
 * For singleton beans, the object is created in the beginning itself irrespective of whether it is autowired or not
 */

By default the scope is singleton


You can not have more than 1 same API
Same API = Same endpoint + Same method
